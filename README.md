## Recipe App
Project for the Software Development course.

### Description
We have created a recipe web application using the Spring Boot and Thymeleaf frameworks in Java. The main purpose of the application is to display recipes and calculate the minimum price of a basket of ingredients required to prepare each recipe. We have implemented web scraping to gather ingredient data from an online market and mapped them into our database.

## User Stories

1. I've always wanted to bake a pineapple cake, but it needs so many exotic ingredients I don't know where to get from. There are tons of shops and I don't have time to go through all of them 'cause I'm busy taking care of my kids. I wish an app could tell me exactly where I would need to buy my ingredients from.

2. I love my fish and chips, but I'm starting to get bored of eating the same thing day-in, day-out. My chess-playing mates gave me some interesting recipe ideas, but I'm frankly too old to go shopping to go so many places to get what I need. It would be such a blessing if there were an app that would make my shopping cart for me.

3. I'm broke so I spend a lot of time searching for the cheapest foods and ingredients so I can cook for myself. But whenever I'm my exam periods, I notice my eating habits get out of control. I don't have much time to get the best bang for my buck so I prefer eating less often and that perishes my productivity. It'd make my life so much easier if there was a way I could get the best offers in just a few clicks.

4. Lately, I've been changing my eating habits, but I get bored so easily of healthy foods. My nutritionits keeps suggesting I try this and that, but I don't wanna spend so much time preparing to cook. It feels like a chore to go shopping for ingredients to different shops to find what I need and it's so frustrating ignoring the fast foods. It'd make my health loss journey a breeze if I didn't have to search for the ingredients myself.

5. I've been watching a lot of Gordon Ramsey recently and I'm enamored with his cooking. Me and my husband have been planning to try some Mojo-marinated chicken quinoa bowl with spinach, but we're too overwhelmed by the assemble. We've been looking for cilantro leaves for weeks now and I so wish there was an app that could tell us where to get it from.

6. As a new college student living on my own for the first time, I struggle to cook my own meals and often resort to eating junk or frozen meals. I wish there was an app that would make it easy for me to learn how to cook by displaying step-by-step instructions for recipes. Having an app like this would make cooking less intimidating and encourage me to make healthier choices. 

***<p align= "right">- Jane, a college student who doesn't know how to cook</p>***


7. I've gotten really into cooking recently. It has become a fun hobby for me, and I find myself constantly trying out new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. Sometimes I have questions or feedback about the recipes I use and wish that the app would allow me to leave comments on recipes. It would be of great help if there was a comment section on each recipe page where I could leave a comment for the recipe author or other users to see. It would make it easier for me to connect with other cooking enthusiasts and share tips, advice, and feedback with each other.

8. I have a busy job, but when I do have time, I love to cook for myself and my family. I often find myself struggling to keep track of all the recipes I want to try. I wish the app would provide a feature for saving recipes to a personalized list so I can easily access them in the future. It would make it easier for me to keep track of the recipes I want to make and ensure that I can plan my meals ahead of time without having to worry about forgetting any of my favorite dishes.

***<p align= "right">- A business man who loves cooking in his free time</p>***

9. As a cooking enthusiast, I often create my recipes and share them with others. However, sometimes I realize that I made a mistake or I want to make a change to a recipe I already posted on my profile. It would be really convenient if I could access my recipes and edit the ingredient list, cooking instructions, or other details. I would also appreciate the ability to delete recipes that I no longer want to share or have changed my mind about. I wish there was an app that would give me more control over my recipe collection and ensure that I am sharing accurate and updated versions of my creations.

10. I frequently use cooking apps to search for new recipes to cook for my kids. The problem is, I often find myself overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. I wish there was an app that could analyze my search history and provide personalized recipe recommendations based on my preferences.

## :jigsaw: Design patterns!

1. :construction_worker: Builders, _lots of them_. We had to handle classes with lots of attributes (Product and Recipe, for example, have about 18 and 7 attributes each) and we didn't want to exacerbate our collective tendinitis by writing so many constructors. They are pleasing almost eyecandy, easy to maintain, and extremely handy!

2. :factory: Factory. For added flexibility and control when creating the logging classes (which might seem needless, but made debugging a breeze), we went for this pattern. Having a pool of loggers to choose from enhances code readability by keeping everything centralized.
