## User Stories

1) I've always wanted to bake a pineapple cake, but it needs so many exotic ingredients I don't know where to get from. There are tons of shops and I don't have time to go through all of them 'cause I'm busy taking care of my kids. I wish an app could tell me exactly where I would need to buy my ingredients from. - Busy mom with kids

2) I love my fish and chips, but I'm starting to get bored of eating the same thing day-in, day-out. My chess-playing mates gave me some interesting recipe ideas, but I'm frankly too old to go shopping to go so many places to get what I need. It would be such a blessing if there were an app that would make my shopping cart for me. - Old british gentleman

3) I'm broke so I spend a lot of time searching for the cheapest foods and ingredients so I can cook for myself. But whenever I'm my exam periods, I notice my eating habits get out of control. I don't have much time to get the best bang for my buck so I prefer eating less often and that perishes my productivity. It'd make my life so much easier if there was a way I could get the best offers in just a few clicks. - College student at FMI UB

4) Lately, I've been changing my eating habits, but I get bored so easily of healthy foods. My nutritionits keeps suggesting I try this and that, but I don't wanna spend so much time preparing to cook. It feels like a chore to go shopping for ingredients to different shops to find what I need and it's so frustrating ignoring the fast foods. It'd make my health loss journey a breeze if I didn't have to search for the ingredients myself. - Young man trying to lose weight

5) I've been watching a lot of Gordon Ramsey recently and I'm enamored with his cooking. Me and my husband have been planning to try some Mojo-marinated chicken quinoa bowl with spinach, but we're too overwhelmed by the assemble. We've been looking for cilantro leaves for weeks now and I so wish there was an app that could tell us where to get it from - Woman in her 30's passionate about Gordon Ramsey
